## Problem Identification
Traditional library management systems are mostly manual.
They cause problems such as:
- Difficulty in tracking issued and returned books

- No real-time availability of books

## Justification
A digital Library Management System improves efficiency,
accuracy, and accessibility by using ICT tools.

- Book records
- Student/member records
- Issue and return details
- Availability status of books

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Canva (System architecture diagram)
- Overleaf (LaTeX documentation)
